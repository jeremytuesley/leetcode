# LeetCode Attempts

## Hi! Welcome! :bowtie:

:raised_hand: These are my leetcode attempts, at time of writing, they're all done in JavaScript. <br /> I've put README's in each folder of each attempt, and also the problem details itself and also my code.

## Why?

I'm doing this for practice, to become a better software engineer and also because I'm finding them pretty fun. (Liked solving Math problems as well).

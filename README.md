# LeetCode Attempts

## Hi! Welcome! :bowtie:

:raised_hand: These are my leetcode attempts, at time of writing, they're all done in JavaScript. <br /> I've put README's in each folder of each attempt, explaining my thoughts, the problem details itself and also my code.

## Why?

I'm doing this for practice, to become a better software engineer and also because I'm finding them pretty fun. (Liked solving Math problems as well).
<br /><br />
If you find this cool, have any suggestions, or want to work with me, feel free to reach out to me! <br />

Would be happy to hear from you! :)

## Study Plan

Every 20 or so questions, I plan to go back to the question, not look at my code, and re-attempt the question to ensure I'm absorbing how to do it. I also hope to improve on my code, as I feel I'll be learning new ways to solve these problems with better efficiency. <br /> <br />

Thanks for reading this far. Enjoy :grin:
